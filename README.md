# Echo
`Echo` is a real-time voice call application.
It is a practice project for me to practice `rust` and `tokio`, and is deeply inspired by `mini-redis`.


## Why Echo
I often play with my friends using `KooK` and think it is a reasonable to use a real-time voice call application as my
start-up rusty project (hopefully).
